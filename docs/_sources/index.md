# Graupel-2

Graupel-2 is a planned High Altitude Balloon launch designed with the goal of sending a balloon to 100,000' or more,
capturing a high definition video of the flight, and recovering the payload.  It is a follow-up to the mostly successful
[Graupel-1](https://sea7aero.space/graupel-1) mission with improvements to the payload and tracker software designed to
hopefully fix the problem of our camera battery getting too cold and dying half way through the mission.

In addition, it is serving as a test bed for the [PyHAB](https://sea7aero.space/pyhab) python library for HAB flight
simulations.
